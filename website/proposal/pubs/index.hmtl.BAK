focuses on Web Syndication - a concept that enhances the World Wide Web
experience by helping users to keep track of the updates made to their
favorite websites, blogs and web content in general. Web Syndication is
attractive and becoming increasingly popular, as testified by the
number of top sites that already offer RSS [1] feeds. In effect, the
ability to automatically aggregate and update many web feeds,
summarizing the content of many different sources, makes Web
Syndication a convenient and natural addition to the World Wide Web,
especially since the underlying model of the latter has relied
implicitly on the users to poll the web sources themselves in order to
stay up-to-date. </span><br
 style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">In time,
Web Syndication could very well evolve into a full fledged notification
service for the World Wide Web. Although that is still somewhat
speculative, an informal survey of the syndication content provided by
major web content providers already shows that it is being used to
disseminate popular, time-critical events, such as news alerts and
sport results. Such usage is surely appealing but raises important
scalability concerns, which are worsened if more aggressive
requirements in liveliness (event freshness) are factored in. The root
of the problem lies in the fact that Web Syndication is currently being
pursued based on models [1, 2] that essentially only detail the web
feed structure and, for all practical purposes, still rely on
client-side polling as the basis for collecting updates. This
straightforward model had the advantage of allowing a quick,
incremental deployment of the service on top of the already existing
server infrastructure but, in the future, it could lead to considerable
strains on the communication budgets of content providers and users
alike. Improving liveliness is expensive using polling techniques and
multiplied by large-scale it translates to the costly problem of
dealing with large numbers of users polling frequently and
systematically many web feeds. This could ultimately lead to a backlash
or complete abandonment of Web Syndication, reenacting a similar
episode to PointCast &#769;s debacle [3]. </span><br
 style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">There are
other issues in the current approaches to Web Syndication. An important
one pertains to its poor suitability when considered in conjunction
with Mobility. Again, client-side polling is, generally, a poor choice
for mobile environments. It is wasteful in terms of energy and
bandwidth, both of which are often scarce and expensive in those
situations. In mobility-driven scenarios, where disconnection and poor
connectivity are the norm, the user is likely less interested in a full
report of each of the web feeds he/she subscribes but, instead, would
prefer to be alerted for particularly important events. In fact, it is
arguable that the ability to filter web feeds and prioritize events is
desirable even for the generality of users. Addressing these issues
introduces interesting challenges to Web Syndication, mainly in the
form of large-scale notification with filtering requirements, which is
a current research topic, e.g. [4, 5]. </span><br
 style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">We intend
to address the problems discussed above by pursuing large-scale Web
Syndication in a cooperative manner. Under such principle, the
server-side model will be preserved and it will be up to the clients
with similar interests to act in concert towards the desired goal.
Together, they will be involved in collecting, filtering and
distributing web feeds content among themselves. In order to achieve
these goals, we will devise ways to incorporate P2P principles to form
the basis of an alternative Web Syndication event dissemination
infrastructure, which will be modeled primarily around a (true)
push-based model [3]. Additionally, the project will seek ways to
enhance the Web Syndication model with support for fine-grained
filtering and prioritization of syndication content in ways compatible
to its large-scale dissemination goals and, in particular, without
cumbering the servers with that additional effort. </span><br
 style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <br style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">
      <span style="font-family: Times New Roman,Times,serif;">We also
want to explore social networking concepts to allow users with similar
interests (subscriptions) to share information automatically and
benefit from their experience as a collective. This opportunity is
missed in the prevalent Web Syndication model, in which users act alone
and interact with servers completely isolated from each other, yet it
becomes feasible and natural with the move to a P2P-based
infrastructure, as we advocate. However, this can be a potential source
for abuse, so this aspect must be addressed in the proposed solution in
a suggestive, non-intrusive spirit and include proper safeguards to
avoid spam-like problems. In addition to that, it will be important to
ensure that the move from an individualistic subscription model to a
distributed, cooperative one does notjeopardize other basic security
requirements, such as privacy, authenticity and fair use. </span><br
