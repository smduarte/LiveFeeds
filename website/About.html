      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
      <p>LiveFeeds focuses on Web Syndication - a concept that enhances
        the World Wide Web experience by helping users to keep track of
        the updates made to their favorite websites, blogs and web
        content in general. Web Syndication is attractive and becoming
        increasingly popular, as testified by the number of top sites
        that already offer RSS [1] feeds. In effect, the ability to
        automatically aggregate and update many web feeds, summarizing
        the content of many different sources, makes Web Syndication a
        convenient and natural addition to the World Wide Web,
        especially since the underlying model of the latter has relied
        implicitly on the users to poll the web sources themselves in
        order to stay up-to-date.<br>
      </p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"> In time, Web Syndication could
        very well evolve into a full fledged notification service for
        the World Wide Web. Although that is still somewhat speculative,
        an informal survey of the syndication content provided by major
        web content providers already shows that it is being used to
        disseminate popular, time-critical events, such as news alerts
        and sport results. Such usage is surely appealing but raises
        important scalability concerns, which are worsened if more
        aggressive requirements in liveliness (event freshness) are
        factored in. The root of the problem lies in the fact that Web
        Syndication is currently being pursued based on models [1, 2]
        that essentially only detail the web feed structure and, for all
        practical purposes, still rely on client-side polling as the
        basis for collecting updates. This straightforward model had the
        advantage of allowing a quick, incremental deployment of the
        service on top of the already existing server infrastructure
        but, in the future, it could lead to considerable strains on the
        communication budgets of content providers and users alike.
        Improving liveliness is expensive using polling techniques and
        multiplied by large-scale it translates to the costly problem of
        dealing with large numbers of users polling frequently and
        systematically many web feeds. This could ultimately lead to a
        backlash or complete abandonment of Web Syndication, reenacting
        a similar episode to PointCast &#769;s debacle [3].<br>
        <br>
        There are other issues in the current approaches to Web
        Syndication. An important one pertains to its poor suitability
        when considered in conjunction with Mobility. Again, client-side
        polling is, generally, a poor choice for mobile environments. It
        is wasteful in terms of energy and bandwidth, both of which are
        often scarce and expensive in those situations. In
        mobility-driven scenarios, where disconnection and poor
        connectivity are the norm, the user is likely less interested in
        a full report of each of the web feeds he/she subscribes but,
        instead, would prefer to be alerted for particularly important
        events. In fact, it is arguable that the ability to filter web
        feeds and prioritize events is desirable even for the generality
        of users. Addressing these issues introduces interesting
        challenges to Web Syndication, mainly in the form of large-scale
        notification with filtering requirements, which is a current
        research topic, e.g. [4, 5].<br>
        <br>
        We intend to address the problems discussed above by pursuing
        large-scale Web Syndication in a cooperative manner. Under such
        principle, the server-side model will be preserved and it will
        be up to the clients with similar interests to act in concert
        towards the desired goal. Together, they will be involved in
        collecting, filtering and distributing web feeds content among
        themselves. In order to achieve these goals, we will devise ways
        to incorporate P2P principles to form the basis of an
        alternative Web Syndication event dissemination infrastructure,
        which will be modeled primarily around a (true) push-based model
        [3]. Additionally, the project will seek ways to enhance the Web
        Syndication model with support for fine-grained filtering and
        prioritization of syndication content in ways compatible to its
        large-scale dissemination goals and, in particular, without
        cumbering the servers with that additional effort.<br>
        <br>
        We also want to explore social networking concepts to allow
        users with similar interests (subscriptions) to share
        information automatically and benefit from their experience as a
        collective. This opportunity is missed in the prevalent Web
        Syndication model, in which users act alone and interact with
        servers completely isolated from each other, yet it becomes
        feasible and natural with the move to a P2P-based
        infrastructure, as we advocate. However, this can be a potential
        source for abuse, so this aspect must be addressed in the
        proposed solution in a suggestive, non-intrusive spirit and
        include proper safeguards to avoid spam-like problems. In
        addition to that, it will be important to ensure that the move
        from an individualistic subscription model to a distributed,
        cooperative one does notjeopardize other basic security
        requirements, such as privacy, authenticity and fair use.<br>
