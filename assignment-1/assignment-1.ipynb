        "## Goals\n",
        "With this assignment students will get a better understanding of how packet switching networks work, what is the transit time of packets in this type of networks and the way to compute it, and how packet switchning network properties impact the end-to-end performance of sending information from a node to another one.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Assumptions\n",
        "In what follows we will consider, by hypothesis, that all links are perfect and never corrupt or loose packets. The same property applies to nodes - they are bullet proof and never crash or loose packets. Also, as we are using CNSS, all computations are performed instantly, without any delay.\n",
        "\n",
        "Network configurations of the different experiments made in this assignment use links with the same characteristics: bandwidth of 2 M bits per second, or 2,000,000 bps, and a propagation time, or latency, of 20 ms, since they have 4,000 Km each (4000 Km / 200,000 Km per second = 4 x 10^3 / 2 x 10^5 Km per second = 2 x 10^-2 s = 20 ms).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Understanding store & forward, end-to-end transit time and the time required to transfer information in a packet switched network\n",
        "\n",
        "**WARNING 1: please study section 3.2 and 3.3 of the book supporting the course to fully understand this section.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**WARNING 2: please do not forget to update CNSS to its lastest version.**\n",
        "\n",
        "In what follows, we are going to make several experiments with the goal of understanding which factors contribute to the transit time of a packet in a network, as well as to get a first glimpse of what impacts the time required to transfer information from one node to a different one in a packet switched network.\n",
        "\n",
        "The three network configurations used in the first set of experiments [configs/config1.1.txt](configs/config1.1.txt), [configs/config1.2.txt](configs/config1.2.txt) and \n",

Nevertheless, the experiments also show that it is not very interesting to use huge sized packets (this is a relative concept related to the bandwidth of links) as we will see next.\n",

While the switch can send and receive several packets in parallel over different links, each packet can only be forwarded after being fully received, analysed and processed. It is only then that the outgoing interface in its way to the destination is choosen and its transmission may proceed. As such, if we replace one link by several links interconnected by switches, even if the sum of the latencies of the new links is equal to the latency of the replaced one, each link introduces an extra transmission time to the packet end-to-end transfer time.\n",

However in experiment 2 the same transfer takes 840 ms and 1260 ms in experiment 3. From one experiment to the following, the transfer time increased 420 ms. That increase is also due to the same reason, a transmission time plus the latency of the extra switch and link introduced eah time. However, now, the transmission time of the big packet takes 400 ms instead of the 40 ms that each \"small\" packet took. \n",

You should be convinced at the end, that computing transfer times in a network where no packets are lost, and there is no competing traffic (other sources sending packets that cross the same links that your packets also cross) is not difficult at all.\n",

If you increase the bandwithd of links from 2 Mbps, to, for example, 100 Mbps or to 1000 Mbps (1 Gbps), the transmission times become very small. For example, sending 80,000 bits at 1 Mbps requires 80 ms, while sending the same packet at 1 Gbps only requires 0,08 ms or 80 micro seconds. As the bandwidth increases, the dominant factor in end-to-end transit time is links latency.\n",

        "**Warning:** when changing a configuration file, you should pay attention to the fact that you may not make mistakes or otherwise NCSS crashes miserably. In particular, each token in the file must be separated from the next one by exactly one space character and you must not enter lines with only spaces. In a next version we will improve the configuration file parsing habilities of CNSS.\n",
        "\n",
        "A last interesting observation concerning CNSS is related to the fact that these three configuration files have no stop parameter. Sometimes it is not required to introduce one, since CNSS recognizes that no more events can be fired in the simulation and stops its processing."

The previous experiments solutions cannot deal with these real world problems and will fail, since the data sent and received may differ. In assignment 2 we will study methods to deal with these characetristics of real networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, the previous shown data transfer solutions also cannot deal with another problem, related, not with the network, but with the characteristics of real world nodes, namely, the fact that their processing capacities are different. Therefore, a very powerful node can send data at a rate that a less powerful receiver one is not able to process timely. If that is the case, packets may also be lost because the receiver cannot process all the packets that it receives, and the only solution is to discard some of them. The final result is the same as if these discarded packets were not delivered by the network.\n",

        "Solutions to this problem are know as ***flow adaptation*** or ***flow control*** solutions, that provide methods to adapt the sending rate of senders to the processing rate of receivers.\n",

        "There exists another problem of rate adaptation related with the fact that an high capacity sender can saturate a network not able to deliver packets sent at a too high rate. For example, at the same time, other nodes are also sending many packets that cross the same links as our high performance sender. In that case, it is also necessary to adapt the rate of the sending nodes to the capacity available inside the network. The solution to this probleam is called ***network congestion control***.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flow control methods and network congestion control methods are different, but both share some common characteristics. In fact, both may rely on signals sent by receivers (or the network) to senders, telling them to stop, refraining sending packets, or to continue sending them. Both methods are discussed in several chapters of the book, namely chapters 6, 7 and 8. By now you do not need to study these chapters to understand this assignment, but you will need them for the next assigments.\n",

Each time the sender sends a packet, it will enter a waiting phase, up to reception of a signal from the receiver meaning that it received the packet and it is ready for the next one. These small signal packets are known as acknowledgement packets or ACK packets.\n",

        "The application algorithm of a receiver node using this protocol is available in file [FilesReceiverAck.java](files/FilesReceiverAck.java). Again, the only upcall worth discussion is the `on_receive()` one, see below.
